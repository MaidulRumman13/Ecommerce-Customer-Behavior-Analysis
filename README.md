This project analyzes an e-commerce customer behavior dataset using Python to uncover insights related to customer retention, satisfaction, and business performance.

## 📊 Dataset
- Size: 10,000 customer records
- Domain: E-commerce customer behavior
- Data quality: No missing or duplicate values

- Visualize key business patterns
- Identify drivers of customer retention and satisfaction
- Provide actionable business recommendations

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

## 📈 Key Insights
- Customer retention is driven more by satisfaction and subscription status than by discounts

- High-value regions such as Barisal and Khulna generate stronger transaction values

## 💡 Business Recommendations
- Introduce faster delivery for Premium subscribers
- Optimize logistics in high-value regions
- Improve post-purchase experience to increase satisfaction
- Enhance mobile UX for intent-driven shoppers
