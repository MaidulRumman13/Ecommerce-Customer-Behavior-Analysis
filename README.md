# E-commerce Customer Behavior Analysis (Python)

This project presents an end-to-end **Python-based data analysis** of an e-commerce customer behavior dataset.  
The goal is to uncover insights related to **customer retention, satisfaction, purchasing behavior, and business performance** using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization.

---

## 📊 Dataset Overview
- **Records:** 10,000 customer transactions  
- **Domain:** E-commerce  
- **Format:** CSV  
- **Data Quality:** No missing values or duplicate records  

The dataset contains demographic details, purchase behavior, delivery information, satisfaction ratings, and subscription attributes.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Validate and prepare raw data for analysis
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Identify patterns affecting customer retention and satisfaction
- Analyze purchasing behavior across regions, devices, and payment methods
- Generate actionable business insights and recommendations

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
- **Pandas** – data manipulation
- **NumPy** – numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** – visualizations
- **Seaborn** – statistical charts
- **Jupyter Notebook** – analysis environment

---

## 🔍 Analysis Levels & Key Findings

### 🟢 Level 1: Basic Insights
- Average customer age is approximately **44**, indicating a mature user base
- Customer distribution shows a nearly equal split between **new and return customers**
- **3,369 customers** are subscribed, while the majority remain non-subscribers
- Average delivery time is **7 days across all subscription tiers**, highlighting limited premium differentiation
- **Toys, Books, and Electronics** are the top-performing product categories

---

### 🔵 Level 2: Intermediate Insights
- No meaningful correlation (≈ **0.01**) between time spent on the website and purchase amount, indicating **intent-driven shopping**
- **Barisal and Khulna** show higher average purchase amounts compared to other locations
- Only **~20%** of customers are both highly satisfied (rating 4–5) and return customers

---

### 🔴 Level 3: Strategic Insights
- Customer retention is influenced more by **satisfaction and subscription status** than by discounts
- Premium customers demonstrate loyalty but do not receive clear delivery advantages
- Discounts act more as engagement tools rather than revenue growth drivers

---

## 📈 Visualizations
The project includes:
- Distribution and bar charts for customer behavior
- Correlation plots for behavioral analysis
- Dual-axis and comparative charts for satisfaction and payment methods

Visualizations are designed to clearly communicate insights and support business decisions.

---

## 🧾 Business Recommendations
- Introduce **faster delivery** for Premium subscribers to justify subscription value
- Optimize logistics in **high-value regions** such as Barisal and Khulna
- Improve post-purchase experience to convert **3-star reviewers into 5-star advocates**
- Enhance **mobile user experience (UX)** to support intent-driven customers
